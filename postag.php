        <h2>Brief of an Accident Event</h2>
        <h4 text align="justify"><p class="py-3">The majority of auto injuries occur in accidents under 5mph! It is common to feel fine initially because the body is still in shock then a couple weeks later you may not even be able to get out of bed due to back pain! Be sure you see a chiropractor who specializes in auto accident injuries and your medical doctor right after an accident even if you feel fine.<br>

After an accident, it is wise to seek counsel from a personal injury attorney. Never try and settle a personal injury case on your own. Don’t work with the other parties’ insurance agent to settle your bodily injury case on your own, always hire an attorney. There are normally zero out of pocket expenses and you only pay a percentage of what is collected. A qualified attorney will inform you of your rights according to the state your accident took place in and will make sure you are justly compensated for your injuries, car, possessions, and passengers.<br>

Make sure your children are protected after an accident. Is your child’s car seat ok to reuse after an accident? Find out what to do with a car seat after an accident, how to assure your children are properly evaluated for hidden injuries.<br>

Often people make very costly mistakes when it comes to their automobile after an accident. Thousands of dollars of structure damage can occur even in a 5mph yet the car may appear to be without damage. It can be frustrating to find a reputable auto body shop, be compensated for a rental car, and to know what to do with your car after an accident. </p></h4><br><br><br><br>

  <h1>Follow these recommended guidelines when involved in an accident.</h1><br>
  <h5><p>
1)   Stay calm and avoid placing blame on anyone until the police have arrived.<br><br>
2)  Check for injuries. When in doubt, call an ambulance.<br><br>
3)  Turn on your vehicle’s hazard lights. Place warning cones, flares or warning triangles for safety.<br><br>
4)  Insist on contacting the police even if the other driver does not believe it is warranted.<br>
    Note:  Always consult with an attorney or your own insurance company before signing any paperwork, unless it is for the police or medical personnel.<br><br>
5)  State only the facts and leave emotions out of your statement to the police officer.<br><br>
6)  Obtain names and telephone numbers of eye witnesses.<br><br>
7)  Take pictures if possible.<br><br>
8)  File your accident report when required by law, unless a police report was taken by an officer.<br><br>
9)  If you have serious injuries, do not try to settle your own claim. Contact a personal injury attorney to learn more about your rights. Report your loss to your insurance company, 
    but do not give an official statement to the other drivers’ insurance adjuster without consulting with your attorney or your own insurance company first.<br><br>
10) If you are injured, it is important that you get a thorough evaluation of your injuries by a doctor, such as a chiropractor who specializes in the musculoskeletal system — your bones, muscles, ligaments and tendons</p></h5>
